# ðŸ–§ MPI_CODES

This repository contains a collection of **Message Passing Interface (MPI)** programs demonstrating various parallel computing paradigms, including **blocking**, **non-blocking**, and **collective communication**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Blocking Communication**: Synchronous send/receive operations.
- **Non-Blocking Communication**: Asynchronous operations enabling computation and communication overlap.
- **Collective Communication**: Operations like broadcast and gather for multi-process data exchange.

---

## ðŸ›  Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **MPI Library**: [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/) or [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org/)
- **C Compiler**: e.g., `gcc`
